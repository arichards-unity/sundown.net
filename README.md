Sundown.net
===========

Sundown.net provides .NET bindings for the nice and popular
[sundown markdown library](https://github.com/tanoku/sundown).

The aim of this library is to provide all the functionality
that sundown provides alongside the possibility to do stuff
quickly (simple API).

It is ridicolously fast compared to pure .NET/Regex implementations.
